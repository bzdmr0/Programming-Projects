This is the second assignment of C Programming course.

Description:
Drop Dead is a dice game, created by United States soldiers as an alternative to poker. You will write a
program for playing a Drop Dead game between a player and computer. This will give you practice with
all three control constructs (sequence, selection and repetition). We are including some design
constraints in the “programming task” section, for example, you will need to use functions. This will give
you the experience of decomposing a problem into parts, and then implementing each part in one
highly cohesive, loosely coupled parts as functions.
